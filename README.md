# molecule-plugins

This monorepo contains the following molecule plugins:

- azure
- gce

Each plugin is an python package that is uploaded to pypi on release and you
can install it directly.

Usually, there is no need to install `molecule-plugins` as this can be seen
as a meta-package, one with no content.
